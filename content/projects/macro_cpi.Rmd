## Macrohistory

This data set comes from the MacroFinance and MacroHistory Lab based in University of Bonn. Specifically, the data set used is the [Jord√†-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory Database](https://www.macrohistory.net/database/ "DATABASE"). This database provides comprehensive coverage of long-run macroeconomic and financial data for 18 countries since 1870.

I was introduced to this database during the "Global Capital Markets and Currencies" course taught by Prof. Helene Rey at London Business School in Autumn 2023.

Importing data to country_data and glimpse

```{r data}
country_data <- read_excel("/Users/rq/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/2022-2024 LBS/2023 Term 4 Courses/E306 Global Capital Markets and Currencies/Individual assignment/JSTdatasetR6.xlsx")
glimpse(country_data)
```

## Filtering

Four countries and their CPI data over the years (Germany, Portugal, USA, and Switzerland were chosen for this analysis.

```{r}
# Filter the dataframe
four_countries <- country_data %>% 
  filter(
  country == c("Germany", "Portugal", "USA", "Switzerland")
)
four_countries %>%
  summarise(country, year, cpi) %>% 
  group_by (country)

```

## Plotting the graph

This is to plot the graph of the data, with y-axis as the CPI data, x-axis as years, and Countries were colour coded.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(four_countries, aes(x = year, y = cpi, color = country, group = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +  # Adding points can help visualize individual data points
  labs(title = "CPI Over Years by Country", x = "Year", y = "CPI") +
  theme_minimal()
```
